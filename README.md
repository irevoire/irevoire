## Hey there!

My name is Tamo, I've been working for @meilisearch for the past 4.5 years, and
I'm now looking for new opportunities. Feel free to reach out if I
could be a good fit somewhere.

I've been living in Le vigan (south of France) for a few years now and don't
plan to move anywhere else since I adopted a beautiful dog that can't live in
a city:

I've been interested in development for more than 10 years now, graduated from
university of Lille and specialized in "low level" code. I almost did a PhD on
DDoS mitigation. And then wrote high-performance code for Meilisearch where I
learned everything I know today about databases.

### Interests

- Ideally, I would like to continue working with the Rust language.
- I love programming languages and dev tooling. I would love working on an LSP
  for example, I've worked on SDK in the past and maintained a big CLI over
  the meilisearch API.
- I like databases, the performance part as well as the UI/UX part.

### Tools

- **Text editor**: I use [helix](https://helix-editor.com/)
- **VCS**: I use [jj](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/)
- **OS**: I have a linux desktop with [arch](https://archlinux.org/) and
  [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) as well as a mac
- **Keyboards**: I own a cool Kyria and Elora from
  [splitkb](https://splitkb.com/). I write with [ergo-l](https://ergol.org/)
  (a layout optimized to write in French and English).
